Feature selection techniques have been used as the workhorse in biomarker discovery applications for a long time. Surprisingly, the stability of feature selection with respect to sampling variations has long been under-considered. It is only until recently that this issue has received more and more attention. In this article, we review existing stable feature selection methods for biomarker discovery using a generic hierarchical framework. We have two objectives: (1) providing an overview on this new yet fast growing topic for a convenient reference; (2) categorizing existing methods under an expandable framework for future research and development."

Homology models of cytochrome P450 105P2 (CYP105P2) were constructed using four P450 structures, CYP105A1, CYP105, CYP165B3 and CYP107L1, as templates for the model building. Using Accelrys Discovery Studio 2.1 software, the lowest energy CYP105P2 model was then assessed for stereochemical quality and side-chain environment. Further active site optimization of the CYP105P2 model built using these templates was performed by molecular dynamics to generate the final CYP105P2 model. The substrates, flavone, flavanone, quercetin and naringenin, were docked into the model. The model-flavone complex was used to validate the active site architecture, and structurally and functionally important residues were identified by subsequent characterization of the secondary structure."

A number of microRNAs (miRNAs) that are evolutionarily conserved not beyond primate lineage have been identified. These primate-specific miRNAs (ps-miRNAs) may attribute to the difference between high-level primates and non-primate mammals or lower vertebrates. Despite of their importance, the genome-wide miRNA conservation patterns and the properties of these ps-miRNAs are largely elusive.
In this study, we developed a robust classification system to assess the conservation pattern of all human mature miRNAs across 44 vertebrate genomes. By this comparative genomic analysis, a novel set of 269 ps-miRNAs were identified. We found that many ps-miRNAs were enriched in chromosome 19 and X, forming two main clusters hereafter referred as C19MC and CXMC, respectively. When comparing the seed of ps-miRNAs themselves or with non-ps-miRNAs, more than one half ps-miRNAs sharing common seeds were belonged to C19MC, 9 of which retained a unique seed that had been reported to be enriched in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) specific miRNAs. Moreover, the most abundant ps-miRNA common seed was possessed by miR-548 family. Most ps-miRNAs had very low expression in adult tissues, which may be attributed to temporal and spatial specific transcript regulation. The ps-miRNAs with relatively high expression were mainly belonged to C19MC and CXMC, and preferentially expressed in hESCs and reproductive system. Sequence anatomy revealed that C19MC ps-miRNAs were highly conserved but not beyond primates and of great sequence similarity. Gene Ontology and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses of predicted target genes indicated that C19MC ps-miRNAs were strongly associated with developmental processes and various cancers.
In conclusion, ps-miRNAs may play critical roles in differentiation and growth regulation during early development, especially in maintaining the pluripotency of hESCs. Results from this study may help explaining the differences between primates and lower vertebrates at genetic level."

A high-throughput resequencing technology has brought family based studies back into genetic research focus. Within-family outliers (the individuals whose phenotype is very much unlike the phenotype of relatives) may carry rare variants of large effects and thus resequencing of these provides a highly powered strategy for rare variants detection. On the other hand, such outliers may complicate search for common variants of smaller effects, because they may obscure a real linkage signal. We have developed a program Ped_Outlier allowing automatic detection of within-family outliers in a sample of pedigrees of arbitrary structure and size. We tested our program by identification of within-family outliers for adult height and intracranial volume in large pedigree. Results of linkage analysis of these traits demonstrated that identification of within-family outliers is one of the important steps of pedigree analysis.
The program Ped_outlier is freely available at http://mga.bionet.nsc.ru/soft/index.html."

Biomarker discovery is a typical application from functional genomics. Due to the large number of genes studied simultaneously in microarray data, feature selection is a key step. Swarm intelligence has emerged as a solution for the feature selection problem. However, swarm intelligence settings for feature selection fail to select small features subsets. We have proposed a swarm intelligence feature selection algorithm based on the initialization and update of only a subset of particles in the swarm. In this study, we tested our algorithm in 11 microarray datasets for brain, leukemia, lung, prostate, and others. We show that the proposed swarm intelligence algorithm successfully increase the classification accuracy and decrease the number of selected features compared to other swarm intelligence methods."

An alternative treatment for staphylococcal infections caused by antibiotic-resistance strains is to lyse staphylococci with peptidoglycan hydrolases, for example, a cysteine, histidine-dependent amidohydrolase/peptidase (CHAP). Here, CHAPs were analyzed in 12 Staphylococcus aureus genomes and 44 staphylococcal phage genomes. There are 234 putative CHAP-containing proteins and only 64 non-identical CHAP sequences. These CHAPs can be classified into phage CHAPs encoded in phages/prophages and bacterial CHAPs encoded on chromosomes and plasmids. The phage CHAPs contain a sequence signature [`]F-[IV]-R', and the bacterial CHAPs mainly do not. The phage CHAPs are mostly positioned at the protein N-termini whereas the bacterial CHAPs are all positioned at the C-termini. The cell wall targeting domains LysM and SH3_5 are associated with the bacterial CHAPs and the phage CHAPs, respectively. The homology modeling reveals that five of six highly conserved residues are clustered at the putative active site and are exposed to the molecular surface."
